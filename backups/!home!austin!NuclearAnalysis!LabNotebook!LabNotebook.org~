* Robustness of the Optical Model under Error Propagation
The goal of this investigation is to study the robustness of a
Woods-Saxon potential when applied to elastic scattering
between a lead target, and lithium-6 and lithium-7 beams. We begin with the Cook potential as a
reference, and make tweaks from there. The Cook potentials are as
follows:

|-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
|     V |     R |     a |     W | R_{i} | a_{i} |
|-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
| 114.2 | 1.286 | 0.853 | 9.440 | 1.739 | 0.809 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------|

[[~/NuclearAnalysis/LabNotebook/NotebookFigures/60MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook.pdf]]

Applying these parameters to 60 MeV scattering with lithium-7 data
yields Fig [[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook]], with a corresponding $\chi^{2}$ value of 0.0771.

Slight modification of the Cook potential was performed with the
purpose of further $\chi^{2}$ minimization. The percent deviations
from the base Cook potential parameters are included beneath each
parameter. Based on these percentages, it would appear the parameter
that required the most alteration was the imaginary potential.

file:NotebookFigures/60MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook.pdf 

Applying this improved fit to the same 60MeV scattering data yields
Fig [[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook]], with a corresponding
$\chi^{2}$ value of 0.0744. While this new fit results in only a
slight reduction of the $\chi^{2}$ value, it is also characterized by
a more accurate prediction of the depth and angle of the first dip
than the original Cook potential. This is important, as this is the
region of interest of this study, and where the fundamental physical
processes that are occuring might be studied.

Now that a baseline has been established, this investigation seeks
primarily to study the validity and robustness of any given Optical
Model potential of the Woods-Saxon form under the effects of
experimental error. That is, despite all precautions during
experimentation, there exists an innate an unavoidable error
associated with the measurement of scattering angles in the lab. It
follows that this error is propagated directly to center of mass angle
calculations as well. However, it is of more use to emulate this
assumption of error through propagation to the calculated values of the ratio to
Rutherford cross-section, as (especially at shallower scattering
angles) slight mismeasurements in the angle result in between a factor
of two to four difference in the calculated cross-section. Thus, for
the purposes of this study, the center of mass angles will defined as
being known with infinite precision.

Data was obtained at lab energies of 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, and 39 MeV
for both lithium-6 and lithium-7, as well as added 44 and 60 MeV data
for the latter. This generous range of energies allows for a sub-study
to be conducted involving the validity of the Cook potentials under
varying lab energies. For each data set, every individual measurement
was smeared randomly and independently of the other measurements. More
specifically, each point was randomly replaced with a new
cross-section value chosen from a uniform distribution ranging between
plus and minus five and ten percent of the particular value being
replaced. 

It will be shown that despite a five percent error
assumption, the Cook Potential describes the data equally as well
for a given energy despite fluctuations in the in the aforementioned
range. Unfortunately, an assertion of a ten percent error demonstrates
a pronounced lack of robustness in the Optical Model potentials in
general, as well as a bolstered sensitivity in general to several of
the Optical Model parameters over others. Further, it will be
demonstrated that upon breakdown of the Cook potentials at lower
energies, unilateral modification of the imaginary parameters of the
Woods-Saxon potential are sufficient to correct the fit to once again
accurately describe the data.

** Five Percent Error Propagation

*** 60 MeV Lithium-7 Lead-208 Elastic Scattering
The original experimental data displayed above for 60 MeV elastic
scattering of lithium-7 on lead-208 was varied as described above
assuming a five percent error in the cross section. Multiple
randomized data sets were created in this range, and fit with both the
Cook potential, and the improved Cook potential given above.

[[file:NotebookFigures/60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1.pdf]]

Initial randomization as displayed in Fig [[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1]] exhibits slight modification
of the data, but still well within the limits of experimental
observation. The corresponding Optical Model fit using the Cook
potentials fits the randomized data well, despite a slight
over-prediction in the region between 35 and 45 degrees in the center
of mass. Fortunately, the dip is well-described, better even than in
the non-randomized data to the naked eye. The displayed fit yielded a
$\chi^{2}$ value of 0.0819, which is slightly higher than in the base
(non-randomized) data. This is a first indication that while
$\chi^{2}$ is in general a useful measure of ``goodness-of-fit,'' it
does not necessarily indicate a better description of the physical
region of interest in the data.

Two more examples of randomization are shown in Figs [[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_2]] and [[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3]] with
$\chi^{2}$ values of 0.0951 and 0.0867, respectively.
It should be noted though that the latter displays a significant
under-calculation of the peak, which has not yet been seen. Overall
though, the Optical Model with the unmodified Cook potential appears
to remain an acceptable description of the experimental data despite
five percent fluctuations.

[[file:NotebookFigures/60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_1.pdf]]

Comparing to the same initially randomized set as above, we obtain Fig
[[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_1]]. While it should be noted that the $\chi^{2}$ value of
this fit, 0.0885, is indeed higher than that of the Cook potential
fit, it appears to the eye to better describe the first dip. Based on
steadfast validity of the Cook potential Optical model fit under
further randomization, it can be asserted that this fit would also
continue to describe the the data equally as well.

*** 39 MeV Lithium-7 Lead-208 Elastic Scattering

[[file:NotebookFigures/39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook.pdf]]

While the seemingly robust application of the Cook potential to the 60
MeV data above suggests an energy invariance, that is unfortunately
not the case. This is a direct result of the now closeness to the
Coulomb barrier, characterized by a rapid change in the cross-section
that may not be able to be accurately described by pure potential
scattering. This energy scale is also characterized by dominant
electromagnetic effects as opposed to nuclear effects more evident at
higher (GeV range) energies. As applied to the base 39 MeV data set,
the Cook potentials yield Fig [[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook]]. To the naked eye, this is
clearly not an acceptable or accurate description of the elastic
scattering. Interestingly though, the fit has a corresponding
$\chi^{2}$ value of 0.0844, which is lower than the third Cook fit
from the 60 MeV randomized data above. Again, $\chi^{2}$ is not always
the best indication of the physical implications and accuracy of the
Optical Model prediction of interest.

#+LABEL:fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook
#+CAPTION:An improved Cook Potential applied to 39 MeV lithium-7, lead-208 elastic scattering data. $\chi^{2}=0.012$
[[file:NotebookFigures/39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook.pdf]]

Through sole manipulation of the imaginary parameters, it was
impossible to obtain an accurate fit at this energy scale. The result
of varying all parameters except for the real potential yielded Fig
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook]]. While managing to fit the majority of the data
exceptionally well, the dip of interest simply could not be reached in
depth, although the corresponding angle is not far off. Again, this is
due to effects caused by closeness in energy to the Coulomb
barrier. The resulting fit (referred to as the Improved Cook Fit for
the duration of the investigation of this particular energy), along
with percent deviation from the base Cook potential is as follows:

|-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------|
|     V |     R |     a |      W |  R_{i} |  a_{i} |
|-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------|
| 114.2 | 1.283 | 0.907 |  9.520 |  1.734 |  0.699 |
|-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------|
|    0% |  0.2% | 6.33% | 0.847% | 0.288% | 13.60% |
|-------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------|

This improved fit yielded a $\chi^{2}$ value of 0.012, roughly a
factor of eight improvement over the base Cook potential. Unlike the
60MeV fit displayed above which necessitated (primarily) a slight
alteration of the imaginary potential, the aforementioned physical
effects due to the nearness to the Coulomb barrier require a
significant shifting of both the imaginary and real difusenesses, with
a greater change being necessary in the former. Unfortunately, this
information cannot and should not be extrapolated to energies in
excess of 60MeV, as the increased distance from the Coulomb barrier
renders the difuseness-altering effects negligible. It is reasonable
though to begin with the above fit, and perform an investigation
into the robustness of the potential in the sub-39 MeV regime. Prior to
doing this though, the robustness of this fit in against five percent
smearing of the data must be explored.

[[file:NotebookFigures/39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3.pdf]]

When the base Cook potential is applied to five percent randomized
data sets, the results are not entirely promising. While the $\chi^2$
values resulting from the fits do not increase significantly, it is
evident even to the naked eye that the potential does not accurately
describe the entire range of data. This is especially evident in the
range between forty and eighty degrees in the center of mass. With
that said, the Cook potential did not satisfactorily describe the
non-randomized data to begin with, so this is not a surprise. Fits of
the randomized data sets can be seen in Figs
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1]], [[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_2]], and
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3]] with corresponding $\chi^2$ values of
0.1068, 0.1273, and 0.1024, respectively.

[[file:NotebookFigures/39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_3.pdf]]

The robustness of the improved fit is satisfactory under five percent
smearing. To the naked eye, there is no discernible deviation of the
fit from the randomized data to necessitate any perturbations of the
potential parameters. This is confirmed by comparison of $\chi^{2}$
values for several randomized sets, while leaving the improved
potential constant. Several plots can be seen in Figs
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_1]],
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_2]], and
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_3]] with corresponding $\chi^2$ values
of 0.0437, 0.0566, and 0.0510 respectively, affirming the claim that
this fit is acceptable within five percent randomization.  Further, it
should be noted that each of these $\chi^2$ values are approximately
half of those corresponding to the base Cook potential for the same
data set. In essence then, the improvement is roughly twice as good at
describing the data, so to speak.

#+LABEL:fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook
#+CAPTION:Cook Potential applied to 35 MeV lithium-7, lead-208 elastic scattering data. $\chi^{2}=0.3164$
[[file:NotebookFigures/35MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook.pdf]]

The effects of closeness to the Coulomb barrier are made all the more
evident by the obvious lack of accuracy from the Cook potential, as
evidenced by [[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook]], with a corresponding $\chi^2$ value of
0.3164. Further, the experimental data display a dampening of the dip
to the point where it is virtually non-existent.

After tweaking of the Cook potential, a much better fit was
obtained. The parameters are as follows:

|-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+--------|
|     V |      R |     a |     W |  R_{i} |  a_{i} |
|-------+--------+-------+-------+--------+--------|

[[file:NotebookFigures/35MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook.pdf]]

The resulting fit can be viewed in Fig
[[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook]], with a corresponding $\chi^2$ value
of 0.0160. Again we see that the fit improvement depends most
importantly on altering the imaginary diffuseness as well as the real
diffuseness. Here also, a decrease in the imaginary potential was
necessary, likely corresponding directly to the slight decrease in lab
energy. This fit is both visually and statistically extremely
proficient at accurately describing the experimental data. It would
appear then that the energy range between 35MeV and 39MeV might not be
acceptably described by pure potential scattering.

While still not a good fit to the data, the base Cook potential
remains just as good/bad despite randomization. It now seems safe to
conclude that this is a feature of whatever potential is chosen,
subjected to randomization at a magnitude of five percent. Plots of
the randomization can be seen in Figs [[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1]],
[[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_2]], and [[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3]],
with corresponding $\chi^2$ values of 0.3506, 0.3765, and 0.3875,
respectively.

The improved Cook potential continues to serve as a superb description

Decreasing the energy once again, we see a complete failure of the
Cook potential. Fitting the experimental data with the base Cook
potential yields Fig [[fig:31MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook]], with a corresponding $\chi^2$
value of 1.0774. This is by far, the worst failure of the Cook
potential that has been displayed. Once again, an improved fit was
found that describes the data extremely well. The improved parameters
are as follows:

Once again we that the necessary changes in the parameters occur in
the real and imaginary diffuseness, as well as in the imaginary
potential, which remained the same as when fitting the 35MeV
data. Again, the largest change is necessary in the imaginary
diffuseness. The resulting fit can be seen in Fig [[fig:31MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook]], with a corresponding
$\chi^2$ value of 0.0234.

Upon applying a five percent smearing, the Cook potential fails even
worse. In Fig [[fig:31MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1]] in particular, the prediction ($\chi^2$ of 1.1423)
fails to touch even a single data point. Further, all of the data is
under-predicted save for a single point. Further examples of this
claim can be seen in Figs [[fig:31MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_2]], and [[fig:31MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3]], with corresponding $\chi^2$ values of

failure at this energy.

A further decrease in energy causes a significant improvement in the
predictive power of the Cook potential, although not to the point of
it being an accurate description of the data. While it does capture
the data to some extent in the region up to roughly one-hundred
degrees in the center of mass, the point at which the physics kicks

The resulting fit can be seen in Fig [[fig:29MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_ImpCook]], with a corresponding $\chi^2$
value of 0.1609. The spread in this data is significantly higher than
in the previous data sets. Due to this, the real potential and radius,
as well as the imaginary radius can be varied slightly without
impacting the overall fit in too harmful of a manner. Due to this
though, the above fit was chosen by minimizing the $\chi^2$ value,
with no visual attributes taken into account.

The Cook potential consistently under-measures the cross section in
the center of mass range beyond roughly one-hundred degrees. This is
demonstrated [[fig:29MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_1]], [[fig:29MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_2]], and [[fig:29MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_Cook_3]], with corresponding $\chi^2$ values

Again, the improved fit holds under randomization, however at this
point that fact is not entirely discernible by eye alone. It would
appear that we have indeed reached an energy limit where reliance on
the $\chi^2$ value of the fit is of more importance than visual
inspection and confirmation. Examples of the fit under variation are
displayed in Figs [[fig:29MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.05_ImpCook_1]],

Application of the initial improved Cook potential  to a ten-percent
randomized set of scattering data results in
[[fig:60MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.10_ImpCook_1]], which has a corresponding $\chi^2$
value of 0.1198. It no longer appears that the improved fit is
sufficient to describe the data. Tweaking in order to minimize
$\chi^2$ results in a new potential of 0.0951.

The most notable, and quantitatively appreciable differences in this
case between my improved fit and the result of refitting the 10\%
smeared data are seen in the imaginary potential and diffuseness. For
the purposes of further analysis, ``significance'' will be
characterized by any parameter that deviates by more than 8\% from
the original Improved Cook deviation.

Tweaking the improved potential yielded the fit depicted in
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.10_TweakedCook_1]] with a corresponding $\chi^2$
of 0.1563. The potential is as follows:

There is a markedly high deviation of the imaginary potential in this
tweaked fit from the original improved fit, which had a 0.847\%
difference from the Cook imaginary potential before randomization. The
imaginary diffuseness has also decreased in variation from 13.60\% to
9.765\%. So, this potential is also appreciably different.

Improving on this yields [[fig:35MeV_208Pb_7Li_0.10_TweakedCook_1]], with
a resulting $\chi^2$ of 0.1511. The potential is as follows:

|-------+--------+--------+---------+--------+---------|

Again, we see the largest difference in the imaginary potential
(6.04\% to 35.5\%) and diffuseness (16.44\% to 23.24\%). This is a
much different potential from the original improvement, and further
supports the notion that at ten-percent randomization/error, fit
potentials can change appreciably.

Interestingly enough, this tweaked potential is more or less
indistinguishable from the initial improved fit. This likely has to
due with skewing effects caused by a closeness in energy to the
Coulomb barrier, however, the effects warrant further study.


* Robustness of the Optical Model under Data Reduction
The uniqueness of a given potential remains a question when the size
of fitting data is considered. That is, does the potential remain
viable when applied to a larger or smaller set of data? Further, what
is the smallest number of data points required to obtain a general
potential, if such a potential exists? Is this number of points energy
invariant? Is this number of points angle invariant?
These questions will be answered by removing every nth point from the
data set, fitting, and comparing $\chi^{2}$ values.

fallacious. There are simply fewer data points near the first dip than
there are in the higher-angle, imaginary region, thus making the fit's

file:NotebookFigures/39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook_N3.pdf 

The initial Cook fit to the unaltered 39 MeV data can be seen in
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook]], with a $\chi^{2}$ value of
0.0844. Plotting every 3rd point yields the base Cook fit seen in
[[fig:39MeV_208Pb_7Li_Base_Cook_N3]], with a $\chi^{2}$ value of
0.0466. Solely going off of this value, it would appear that the fit
was made better by removing points. Of course, this is
fallacious. There are simply fewer data points near the first dip than
there are in the higher-angle, imaginary region, thus making the fit's
nearness to these points improve the $\chi^{2}$. An improvement to the
base Cook potentials was found based on $\chi^{2}$
values. Unfortunately, the improved fit does not exactly capture the
first dip, but it is certainly well within reason. The
improved potential with a corresponding $\chi^{2}$ of 0.0066 is as
follows:

allow meaningful conclusions to be determined.

*** 39 MeV Lithium-7 Lead-208 Elastic Scattering

An improvement to the base Cook potentials was found based on
$\chi^{2}$ values. At this point, the data points that truly define
the dip have been removed. Despite this, the best fit from the $N=5$
data sets above remains the best fit to the $N=6$ data set here, in
terms of $\chi^2$ minimization. The resulting fit using the
above/following parameters yields a $\chi^2$ value of 0.0013.
